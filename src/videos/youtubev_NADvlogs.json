Lizzie Sorkin, Director of Communications stands in frame.\n\nLIZZIE: Hello there!  You know what usually happens at an event when you want to recognize someone, people usually wave their hands in the air to show our applause, or perhaps you may also hear a thundering round of applause in the same room.  Well, here at the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) -- we would like to do the same but how to do so through out the year? We're happy to share a new program idea, called the \"#NADHandwave\"!  In case you're not sure what that sign means, it's a hashtag, which actually belongs in the social media sphere.\n\nThis new program will help the NAD recognize different deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing people in the deaf and hard of hearing community, who really invest themselves in advocating and supporting our community.  It's impossible to know everyone in the community, but you do.  We want to involve you!\n\nVideo freezes then slides to the left, with a new video coming in frame.  Lizzie stands in frame.\n\nLIZZIE: You're wondering how we expect you to be involved aren't you?  Well, the NAD doesn't know everyone in the deaf and hard of hearing community but you do.  You know your locals, your neighbors, friends and so on and you know what they're doing.  You know who deserves recognition, you can let us know! We'd love to get to know them.\n\nVideo freezes then slides to the left, with a new video coming in frame.  Lizzie stands in frame.\n\nLIZZIE: The #NADHandwave will be a monthly effort recognizing different people so don't feel you should share just one name with us, go all out!  \n\nVideo freezes then slides to the left, with a new video coming in frame.  Lizzie stands in frame.\n\nLIZZIE: Of course, we can't forget to share the four guidelines.  First, the nominated person cannot be a current NAD Staff or Board member.  Second, the nominated person cannot have previously received a #NADHandwave already, the person must be a first-timer.   Third, the nominated person must truly value and support the spirit of the NAD and the deaf and hard of hearing community.  Fourth, you need to submit a 200 word brief explanation why you feel that person deserves a #NADHandwave and two other people's contact information for us to contact about the person you want to nominate.   It's simple isn't it?  I bet you're thinking it is so easy that even a five year old could do it...\n\nVideo freezes then slides to the left, with a new video coming in frame.  Lizzie stands in frame.\n\nLIZZIE: In addition to the recognition online, the #NADHandwave recipient will also get a one year membership with the NAD!\n\nVideo freezes then slides to the left, with a new video coming in frame.

Anytime you notice someone who is doing an incredible amount of work, take a moment and ask yourself if you think that person deserves a #NADHandwave and then go ahead and submit another nomination! You can use that website and submit a nomination anytime, 24/7. Now I bet you're thinking of a bunch of names right?  Great, we want to know who.

As the last Miss Deaf America Ambassador, Chanel Gleicher is still performing her duties until the next NAD Conference. We are all very excited to get started with the new program!  In this video, Alim Chandani and Renca Dunn invite YOU to join their committee as they plan the new competition.  \n\nThe new program format will showcase young deaf and hard of hearing female and male Americans who vie to become the NAD ambassadors.

Contestants will compete against each other through five rounds, prior to and during the NAD Conference. Two selected youth ambassadors will work with the NAD to implement a strategic plan that addresses a social issue identified by the contestants during the competition.
