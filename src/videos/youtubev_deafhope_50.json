Very empowering. I really cherish this.\"\n\nTanja Bierschneider: \"This feels very supportive. You know, it's like there are many layers. I think I know all of them, but there are actually deeper layers to this issue. It's like there's a checklist, and I just realized there are more things to check off. I really enjoyed this- very supportive. It's awesome.\"\n\nChristina McMurry: \"Before I came here, I felt my experience was silenced. When I came here, I realize many of us have the same experience. I feel we didn't have that chance or the opportunity to be able to discuss our experiences. And now I see everybody here, I know I''m not the only one. Why couldn't this have happened a long time ago? Why now?\" \n\nLeila Hanaumi: \"Rape culture is a very real thing. All of us have experienced or know someone who has experienced sexual violence or domestic violence. All of us. So, we really have to change our thinking, change our teachings. Don't teach our girls not to get raped, teach our boys not to rape.\" \n\nCara Barnett: \"The idea of rape culture has been very vague. I think it's time to make it clear. Show what rape culture means.\"\n\nSel Staley: \"Rape can happen to anyone.\"\n\nRoz Ramos: \"I've learned so much from this workshop. I realize it's about community accountability. I used to not want to be involved. I thought it wasn't my business. No, community accountability means we need to help each other.

Amara.org: http://www.amara.org/en/v/B7pH/\n\nASL to English Transcript: \n\nHello my name is Brian Berlinski.\n\nI am Mr. Feminist.\n\nAre you a Feminist?\n\nWhat does feminist mean?  it is believing that men and women should be\nequal, not having more power than the other.  This means showing\nrespect, sharing power with each other, exchanging ideas and\ninformation freely.\n\nBeing a feminist means not only fighting against oppression of women,\nbut also fighting against all forms of oppression including that of\nLGBT folks, Deaf people, senior citizens, people of color.  Fighting\nagainst all forms of oppression is inherent in the concept of\nfeminism.\n\nIt is not about fighting against one form of oppression.  When we do\nthis, it stems from silo thinking (silo as a grain silo on a farm).\nSilo thinking means prioritizing one oppression against all others.\nIt means focusing only on supporting one oppressed group and ignoring\nthe fact other groups experience oppression and deserve equal support.\n\nIt is about fighting against all forms of oppression so that we can\nwork together to become stronger, to become united as ONE people.  To\nrecap, feminism also includes fighting against audism, classism,\nracism, ageism, etc.\n\nThe term \"Lavender Revolution,\" what does it mean?  First, let me\nexplain the history behind how we came up with that term in our\ndiscussion.  We picked Lavender because it was close to the color\npurple, and Revolution worked for us because it is about making a\nchange, and change starts with YOU.  When you, or I change, others\nwill also change, which allows us to create a revolution.\n\nWe learned that in history, there was already a \"Lavender Revolution\"\nthat was created by LGBT folks in the 60's and 70's as a fight for\nLGBT rights.  When we discovered this, we felt so inspired to honor\nthis part of history.  And we decided to include in our work ending\nviolence against women our fight against

does feminist mean?  it is believing that men and women should be\nequal, not having more power than the other.  This means showing\nrespect, sharing power with each other, exchanging ideas and\ninformation freely.\n\nBeing a feminist means not only fighting against oppression of women,\nbut also fighting against all forms of oppression including that of\nLGBT folks, Deaf people, senior citizens, people of color.  Fighting\nagainst all forms of oppression is inherent in the concept of\nfeminism.\n\nIt is not about fighting against one form of oppression.  When we do\nthis, it stems from silo thinking (silo as a grain silo on a farm).\nSilo thinking means prioritizing one oppression against all others.\nIt means focusing only on supporting one oppressed group and ignoring\nthe fact other groups experience oppression and deserve equal support.\n\nIt is about fighting against all forms of oppression so that we can\nwork together to become stronger, to become united as ONE people.  To\nrecap, feminism also includes fighting against audism, classism,\nracism, ageism, etc.\n\nThe term \"Lavender Revolution,\" what does it mean?  First, let me\nexplain the history behind how we came up with that term in our\ndiscussion.  We picked Lavender because it was close to the color\npurple, and Revolution worked for us because it is about making a\nchange, and change starts with YOU.  When you, or I change, others\nwill also change, which allows us to create a revolution.\n\nWe learned that in history, there was already a \"Lavender Revolution\"\nthat was created by LGBT folks in the 60's and 70's as a fight for\nLGBT rights.  When we discovered this, we felt so inspired to honor\nthis part of history.  And we decided to include in our work ending\nviolence against women our fight against homophobia.\n\nIncluding all oppressed groups in our work is part of our feminist philosophy.\n\nFor all these reasons, that is why I am proud to call myself Mr. Feminist.",
