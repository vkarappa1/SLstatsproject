Very empowering. I really cherish this.\"\n\nTanja Bierschneider: \"This feels very supportive. You know, it's like there are many layers. I think I know all of them, but there are actually deeper layers to this issue. It's like there's a checklist, and I just realized there are more things to check off. I really enjoyed this- very supportive. It's awesome.\"\n\nChristina McMurry: \"Before I came here, I felt my experience was silenced. When I came here, I realize many of us have the same experience. I feel we didn't have that chance or the opportunity to be able to discuss our experiences. And now I see everybody here, I know I''m not the only one. Why couldn't this have happened a long time ago? Why now?\" \n\nLeila Hanaumi: \"Rape culture is a very real thing. All of us have experienced or know someone who has experienced sexual violence or domestic violence. All of us. So, we really have to change our thinking, change our teachings. Don't teach our girls not to get raped, teach our boys not to rape.\" \n\nCara Barnett: \"The idea of rape culture has been very vague. I think it's time to make it clear. Show what rape culture means.\"\n\nSel Staley: \"Rape can happen to anyone.\"\n\nRoz Ramos: \"I've learned so much from this workshop. I realize it's about community accountability. I used to not want to be involved. I thought it wasn't my business. No, community accountability means we need to help each other.
