(Dec. 6, 2010) — Today, CSD has opened a new contact center and is starting to qualify deaf and hard of hearing consumers from around the nation for Project Endeavor. What is Project Endeavor? Back in July, CSD announced it had been awarded a $14.9 million grant from the National Telecommunications and Information Agency as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This grant enabled CSD to implement a nationwide initiative to provide discounted equipment (a Dell 11z notebook), high-speed Internet access, and life-skills training, for low-income, underserved deaf and hard of hearing people. CSD has named this two-year campaign Project Endeavor.   \n\nProject Endeavor is qualifying deaf and hard of hearing people starting today. The program offers a video-configured Dell 11z notebook, which comes with a mobile broadband card, for $230. The retail price of the notebook is $500, meaning consumers save over 50 percent to start with. For the cost of only $230, consumers receive the new notebook computer along with a 12-month 3G/4G wireless Internet access plan — at no additional cost. The 12-month coverage is a $700 savings to the consumer, if not more, depending on where they live in the United States. The notebook is theirs to keep even after the two-year project reaches completion.\n \nCSD pursued these funds because as the nation's largest deaf and hard of hearing service organization, it understood that many deaf and hard of hearing Americans simply don't have the same level of access to broadband/high-speed Internet services in their homes (or mobile) as their hearing counterparts. In some cases, deaf and hard of hearing people do not have the same financial resources; generally speaking, the deaf and hard of hearing community are more economically disadvantaged than the mainstream hearing community. Project Endeavor changed that concept for deaf and hard of hearing people, and with the 3G/4G wireless plan, consumers will have access not just in their homes, but everywhere they take their notebook computer.\n \n\"Over the past 35 years, CSD's has continually operated with the concept of creating new channels of access for deaf and hard of hearing people — to fill those communication gaps hearing Americans rarely experience and quite possibly, do not understand,\" said Ben Soukup, CSD chief executive officer. \"From being able to stream or download the news, to honing job seeking skills, to using a videophone to keep up with family and friends ...

Project Endeavor achieves all of this, and so much more. CSD is proud to offer this unique and solely deaf and hard of hearing-centered program to our consumers.\"    \n \nDeaf and hard of hearing consumers, who can verify a bilateral hearing loss of 40db or greater, are encouraged to call the Project Endeavor contact center today. The contact center can be reached in a numbers of ways, depending on the consumer's preferred mode of communication. The contact numbers are 877-NETME77 (voice), 877-403-4596 (TTY), 605-550-4056 or 605-644-7399 (VP), and 605-782-8446 (FAX). The contact center can also be reached via e-mail at info@projectendeavor.com. \n \nFor more information on Project Endeavor, go to www.projectendeavor.com.", "type": "text"}, "link": [{"href": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZQmY4IsLhk&feature=youtube_gdata", "type": "text/html", "rel": "alternate"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/5ZQmY4IsLhk/responses", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video.responses"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/5ZQmY4IsLhk/related", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video.related"}, {"href": "https://m.youtube.com/details?v=5ZQmY4IsLhk", "type": "text/html", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#mobile"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/CSDMedia/uploads/5ZQmY4IsLhk", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "self"}], "published": {"$t": "2010-12-06T14:41:36.000Z"}, "id": {"$t": "http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/5ZQmY4IsLhk"}}, {"category": [{"term": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video", "scheme": "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind"}, {"term": "Nonprofit", "scheme": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/categories.cat", "label": "Nonprofits & Activism"}], "updated": {"$t": "2011-03-02T23:24:47.000Z"}, "gd$comments": {"gd$feedLink": {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/RuXgggCQ0x4/comments", "countHint": 0, "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#comments"}}, "title": {"$t": "BTOP Dell DealFull HQ 16x9", "type": "text"}, "app$control": {"app$draft": {"$t": "yes"}}, "media$group": {"media$player": [{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuXgggCQ0x4&feature=youtube_gdata_player"}], "media$category": [{"$t": "Nonprofit", "scheme": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/categories.cat", "label": "Nonprofits & Activism"}], "media$title": {"$t": "BTOP Dell DealFull HQ 16x9", "type": "plain"}, "yt$duration": {"seconds": "236"}, "media$content": [{"medium": "video", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/v/RuXgggCQ0x4?version=3&f=user_uploads&app=youtube_gdata", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "yt$format": 5, "duration": 236, "expression": "full", "isDefault": "true"}, {"medium": "video", "url": "rtsp://v8.cache2.c.youtube.com/CigLENy73wIaHwke05AAguDlRhMYDSANFEgGUgx1c2VyX3VwbG9hZHMM/0/0/0/video.3gp", "type": "video/3gpp", "yt$format": 1, "duration": 236, "expression": "full"}, {"medium": "video", "url": "rtsp://v8.cache2.c.youtube.com/CigLENy73wIaHwke05AAguDlRhMYESARFEgGUgx1c2VyX3VwbG9hZHMM/0/0/0/video.3gp", "type": "video/3gpp", "yt$format": 6, "duration": 236, "expression": "full"}], "media$thumbnail": [{"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RuXgggCQ0x4/0.jpg", "width": 480, "time": "00:01:58", "height": 360}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RuXgggCQ0x4/1.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:00:59", "height": 90}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RuXgggCQ0x4/2.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:01:58", "height": 90}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RuXgggCQ0x4/3.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:02:57", "height": 90}], "media$keywords": {}, "media$description": {"$t": "", "type": "plain"}}, "author": [{"name": {"$t": "CSDMedia"}, "uri": {"$t": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/CSDMedia"}}], "yt$statistics": {"viewCount": "365", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "content": {"$t": "", "type": "text"}, "gd$rating": {"max": 5, "average": 5.0, "numRaters": 3, "rel": "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#overall", "min": 1}, "link": [{"href": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuXgggCQ0x4&feature=youtube_gdata", "type": "text/html", "rel": "alternate"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/RuXgggCQ0x4/responses", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video.responses"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/RuXgggCQ0x4/related", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video.related"}, {"href": "https://m.youtube.com/details?v=RuXgggCQ0x4", "type": "text/html", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#mobile"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/CSDMedia/uploads/RuXgggCQ0x4", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "self"}], "published": {"$t": "2010-12-01T22:18:07.000Z"}, "id": {"$t": "http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/RuXgggCQ0x4"}}, {"category": [{"term": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video", "scheme": "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind"}, {"term": "Nonprofit", "scheme": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/categories.cat", "label": "Nonprofits & Activism"}], "updated": {"$t": "2010-11-15T22:21:14.000Z"}, "gd$comments": {"gd$feedLink": {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/1I7N9h4pyQI/comments", "countHint": 0, "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#comments"}}, "title": {"$t": "Access ...

That scholarship form can also be found at the NLLC Web site.\n \nAbout NLLC — The National Leadership and Literacy Camp (NLLC) fosters intellectual and personal growth and development through activities that embrace the social, physical, intellectual, communicative and emotional (SPICE) domains of learning and becoming.

The DDTP is closely aligned with the mission of our organization which is dedicated to achieving greater access, awareness, and independence for all individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. We look forward to continuing our involvement for many years to come and we remain committed to excellence, integrity, and innovation in all that we do. \n\nA state-of-the-art telecommunications system processes incoming calls in the contact center from consumer telephone (voice, TTY, CapTel, VRS, including non-English language) calls, and can also process contacts via e-mail or in real-time with Web chat. The warehouse distribution center houses required equipment and materials and supports shipping, receiving, accepting returns, testing, refurbishment and scrapping equipment. The tracking system integrates with the contact center and warehouse to track consumer information and service orders which can be accessed from remote locations throughout the State of California. CSD will partner with San Jose Distribution Services for disseminating the equipment. \n\nSan Jose Distribution Services Inc. is extremely proud and honored to be able to continue providing distribution logistics services for such a worthwhile state program that positively affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of Californians, said Gary Minardi, San Jose Distribution Services president.", "type": "text"}, "link": [{"href": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN3S7LCITwk&feature=youtube_gdata", "type": "text/html", "rel": "alternate"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/LN3S7LCITwk/responses", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video.responses"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/LN3S7LCITwk/related", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video.related"}, {"href": "https://m.youtube.com/details?v=LN3S7LCITwk", "type": "text/html", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#mobile"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/CSDMedia/uploads/LN3S7LCITwk", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "self"}], "published": {"$t": "2009-12-22T20:20:57.000Z"}, "id": {"$t": "http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/LN3S7LCITwk"}}, {"category": [{"term": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video", "scheme": "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind"}, {"term": "Nonprofit", "scheme": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/categories.cat", "label": "Nonprofits & Activism"}], "updated": {"$t": "2012-04-05T03:17:27.000Z"}, "gd$comments": {"gd$feedLink": {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/qGGivGWak1I/comments", "countHint": 0, "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#comments"}}, "title": {"$t": "NLLC HS Counselors Intro", "type": "text"}, "media$group": {"media$player": [{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGGivGWak1I&feature=youtube_gdata_player"}], "media$category": [{"$t": "Nonprofit", "scheme": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/categories.cat", "label": "Nonprofits & Activism"}], "media$title": {"$t": "NLLC HS Counselors Intro", "type": "plain"}, "yt$duration": {"seconds": "161"}, "media$content": [{"medium": "video", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/v/qGGivGWak1I?version=3&f=user_uploads&app=youtube_gdata", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "yt$format": 5, "duration": 161, "expression": "full", "isDefault": "true"}, {"medium": "video", "url": "rtsp://v4.cache1.c.youtube.com/CigLENy73wIaHwlSk5plvKJhqBMYDSANFEgGUgx1c2VyX3VwbG9hZHMM/0/0/0/video.3gp", "type": "video/3gpp", "yt$format": 1, "duration": 161, "expression": "full"}, {"medium": "video", "url": "rtsp://v4.cache1.c.youtube.com/CigLENy73wIaHwlSk5plvKJhqBMYESARFEgGUgx1c2VyX3VwbG9hZHMM/0/0/0/video.3gp", "type": "video/3gpp", "yt$format": 6, "duration": 161, "expression": "full"}], "media$thumbnail": [{"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGGivGWak1I/0.jpg", "width": 480, "time": "00:01:20.500", "height": 360}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGGivGWak1I/1.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:00:40.250", "height": 90}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGGivGWak1I/2.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:01:20.500", "height": 90}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGGivGWak1I/3.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:02:00.750", "height": 90}], "media$keywords": {}, "media$description": {"$t": "Campers experience in-depth leadership and literacy training specific to continued growth and development.
