Enjoy!!\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\nI hope the days come easy and the moments pass slow, \r\nAnd each road leads you where you wanna go, \r\nAnd if you're faced with a choice, and you have to choose, \r\nI hope you choose the one that means the most to you.\r\nAnd if one door opens to another door closed, \r\nI hope you keep on walkin' till you find the window, \r\nIf it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile.\r\nBut more than anything, more than anything... \r\n\r\nMy wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to, \r\nYour dreams stay big, your worries stay small, \r\nYou never need to carry more than you can hold, \r\nAnd while you're out there getting where you're getting to, \r\nI hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too, \r\nYeah, this, is my wish.\r\n\r\nI hope you never look back, but you never forget, \r\nAll the ones who love you, in the place you left, \r\nI hope you always forgive, and you never regret, \r\nAnd you help somebody every chance you get, \r\nOh, you find God's grace, in every mistake, \r\nAnd always give more than you take.\r\nBut more than anything, yeah, more than anything... \r\n\r\nMy wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to, \r\nYour dreams stay big, your worries stay small, \r\nYou never need to carry more than you can hold, \r\nAnd while you're out there getting where you're getting to, \r\nI hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too, \r\nYeah, this, is my wish. Yeah, yeah.\r\n\r\nMy wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to, \r\nYour dreams stay big, your worries stay small, \r\nYou never need to carry more than you can hold, \r\nAnd while you're out there getting where you're getting to, \r\nI hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too, \r\nYeah, this, is my wish (my wish, for you).\r\n\r\nThis is my wish (my wish, for you)\r\nI hope you know somebody loves you (my wish, for you).\r\nMay all your dreams stay big (my wish, for you).", "type": "text"}, "link": [{"href": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQmZ46g_SyE&feature=youtube_gdata", "type": "text/html", "rel": "alternate"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/wQmZ46g_SyE/responses", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video.responses"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/wQmZ46g_SyE/related", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video.related"}, {"href": "https://m.youtube.com/details?v=wQmZ46g_SyE", "type": "text/html", "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#mobile"}, {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/allyballybabe/uploads/wQmZ46g_SyE", "type": "application/atom+xml", "rel": "self"}], "published": {"$t": "2008-09-23T00:12:54.000Z"}, "id": {"$t": "http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/wQmZ46g_SyE"}}, {"category": [{"term": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#video", "scheme": "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind"}, {"term": "Education", "scheme": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/categories.cat", "label": "Education"}], "updated": {"$t": "2013-05-24T23:29:24.000Z"}, "gd$comments": {"gd$feedLink": {"href": "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/_QLWfZ-OGKI/comments", "countHint": 544, "rel": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007#comments"}}, "title": {"$t": "\"Piece Of Me\" in ASL", "type": "text"}, "gd$rating": {"max": 5, "average": 4.9052825, "numRaters": 549, "rel": "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#overall", "min": 1}, "media$group": {"media$player": [{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QLWfZ-OGKI&feature=youtube_gdata_player"}], "media$category": [{"$t": "Education", "scheme": "http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/categories.cat", "label": "Education"}], "media$title": {"$t": "\"Piece Of Me\" in ASL", "type": "plain"}, "yt$duration": {"seconds": "203"}, "media$thumbnail": [{"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QLWfZ-OGKI/0.jpg", "width": 480, "time": "00:01:41.500", "height": 360}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QLWfZ-OGKI/1.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:00:50.750", "height": 90}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QLWfZ-OGKI/2.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:01:41.500", "height": 90}, {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QLWfZ-OGKI/3.jpg", "width": 120, "time": "00:02:32.250", "height": 90}], "media$content": [{"medium": "video", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/v/_QLWfZ-OGKI?version=3&f=user_uploads&app=youtube_gdata", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "yt$format": 5, "duration": 203, "expression": "full", "isDefault": "true"}, {"medium": "video", "url": "rtsp://v8.cache2.c.youtube.com/CigLENy73wIaHwmiGI6ffdYC_RMYDSANFEgGUgx1c2VyX3VwbG9hZHMM/0/0/0/video.3gp", "type": "video/3gpp", "yt$format": 1, "duration": 203, "expression": "full"}, {"medium": "video", "url": "rtsp://v8.cache2.c.youtube.com/CigLENy73wIaHwmiGI6ffdYC_RMYESARFEgGUgx1c2VyX3VwbG9hZHMM/0/0/0/video.3gp", "type": "video/3gpp", "yt$format": 6, "duration": 203, "expression": "full"}], "media$restriction": {"$t": "DE", "type": "country", "relationship": "deny"}, "media$keywords": {}, "media$description": {"$t": "\"Piece of Me\" by Britney Spears, expressed in American Sign Language.\r\n[All lyrics and music are property and copyright of Britney Spears.
